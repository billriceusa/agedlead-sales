/**
 * The same-page alternative on a competitor's provider profile.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * `/providers/{slug}` is the only page on this site that links out to a provider
 * that pays us nothing, and it was the whole of the leak: in the 30 days to
 * 2026-10-05 GA4 recorded 202 outbound clicks, 157 to the partner and 42 to
 * non-paying providers, and every one of those 42 carried
 * `utm_campaign=provider-{slug}` — the hero "Visit Website" button, the single
 * call site of `providerWebsiteUrl`. The reader at peak purchase intent was
 * offered one destination, and it was the one that pays nothing.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY IS NOT
 *
 * The competitor's link keeps its primary styling and its position in the hero.
 * Nothing is removed, demoted, or buried. The independence of these reviews is
 * the only reason the directory is worth reading, and it is the premise of
 * /methodology; trading it for a few clicks would cost more than the clicks are
 * worth. What changes is that the alternative now exists at the decision point
 * instead of six screens below it.
 *
 * Everything it claims is checkable on this site: the two scores come from the
 * published six-dimension ratings, the "highest in the directory" line is
 * asserted against the data in lib/provider-store-match.test.ts rather than
 * written in by hand, and a vertical is only linked when the partner has a real
 * buy page for it. Where there is no catalogue overlap — Lead Tycoons and
 * Synergy Direct Solution sell only MCA leads — it says so and offers no
 * affiliate link at all.
 *
 * Measure it with `utm_content=store-alternative` and
 * `utm_campaign=provider-alt-{slug}` in `/api/reports/outbound-clicks`.
