/**
 * The sitewide bottom CTA, plus a `compact` in-body variant.
 *
 * ITERATION 11 (2026-10-05) — DESTINATION PARITY WITH THE HERO DOOR
 *
 * `HeroAffiliateDoor` moved to the partner's storefront wherever the vertical is
 * stocked: across two doors, ~25 sessions landed on the partner's MARKETING
 * pages and produced zero add-to-carts, while the weekly newsletter — which has
 * deep-linked past those pages since 2026-08-27 — is the only surface on this
 * property that reliably produces orders. A page of prose has no cart on it.
 * See `lib/store-front.ts` for the segment map, the card-grid provenance and the
 * body-diff verification.
 *
 * This banner renders on the same `/lead-types/[slug]` pages as that hero door.
 * Two doors on one page pointing at two different destinations makes the
 * iteration-11 reading on 2026-11-09 unattributable, so when this banner is
 * given a `leadType` it resolves the SAME precedence, copied from the hero door
 * rather than re-derived.
