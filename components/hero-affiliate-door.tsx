/**
 * The above-the-fold outbound door for commercial pages.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * The 2026-08-18 scoreboard reading (data/loop/ledger.json) separated demand
 * from conversion for the first time. `/providers/aged-lead-store` converted at
 * 43.33% on 90 views and supplied 39 of 69 affiliate clicks; the four biggest
 * `/lead-types/*` pages carried 629 views and converted at ~0.95%.
 *
 * The gap was not CTA *count* — the lead-type pages already carried more
 * affiliate surfaces than the provider page. It was position and destination.
 * The provider page puts an outbound door in the hero
 * (`providers/[slug]/page.tsx`, "Visit Website"); the lead-type heroes offered
 * only two internal links, so a reader at peak intent was routed to another
 * page on this site instead of to the merchant.
 *
 * This component is that missing door, deep-linked to the specific lead type's
 * category rather than the generic catalogue.
 *
 * Intent on a guide page is genuinely lower than on a provider review, so the
 * 43% rate is not the target. The hypothesis under test is 5% — see `nextPick`
 * in the ledger. Measure via `utm_content=hero-door` in
 * `/api/reports/outbound-clicks`, and kill this if it does not move.
 *
 * ITERATION 11 (2026-10-05) — THE DOOR WORKED, THE DESTINATION DID NOT
 *
 * The 2026-08-18 bet above was about door *position*, and on its own terms it
 * won: site-side click rate on the four biggest lead-type pages went 0.95% ->
 * 7.24%. What the store-side scoreboard then showed is that none of those
 * clicks became orders.
 *
 * Store-side GA4 357329146, 2026-09-01 -> 10-05, sessionMedium=affiliate:
 *
 *   lead-type / hero-door      32 sessions   1 add-to-cart   0 orders   $0.00
 *   providers-hub / hero-door  22 sessions  15 add-to-carts  5 orders  $545.00
 *
 * Same component, same window, and the lead-type instance carries MORE
 * sessions than the one earning the money. So the gap is not the component and
 * not the placement. It is where each one points.
 *
 * Splitting `lead-type` sessions by the page they landed on isolates it: of the
 * ~12 that landed on one of the partner's marketing pages — the destinations
 * `storeCategoryPath` returns — zero reached a cart. The campaign's single
 * add-to-cart came from a session landing on /customers/login, i.e. an
 * existing account holder, which is the returning-user artifact already
 * documented for the retired site's header door rather than a reader this door
 * converted.
 *
 * A page of prose has no cart on it. The partner's storefront pages do, along
 * with state filters and live per-lead pricing, and the one surface on this
 * whole property that reliably produces orders — the weekly newsletter, 13
 * sessions -> 3 orders -> $2,224.40 in the same window — has deep-linked past
 * the marketing pages into that storefront since 2026-08-27.
 *
 * This component now does the same wherever the partner stocks the vertical.
 * See `lib/store-front.ts` for the segment map, the card-grid provenance, and
 * the body-diff verification.
 *
 * Unchanged on purpose: a caller that passes no `leadType` (the lead-types hub
 * and the providers hub) resolves no segment and keeps the exact URL it had.
 * The providers hub is the door that earns, so it is deliberately untouched —
 * and a reader who has not named a vertical is better served by the catalogue's
 * card grid, which shows every vertical with its price, than by one segment
 * picked for them.
