/**
 * The single in-body affiliate line on a commercial page.
 *
 * ITERATION 11 (2026-10-05) — DESTINATION PARITY WITH THE HERO DOOR
 *
 * `HeroAffiliateDoor` moved to the partner's storefront wherever the vertical
 * is stocked, because the marketing pages this used to point at measured ~25
 * sessions and ZERO add-to-carts across two doors while the newsletter — which
 * has deep-linked past them since 2026-08-27 — is the only surface on this
 * property that produces orders. See `lib/store-front.ts` for the segment map,
 * the card-grid provenance and the body-diff verification.
 *
 * On `/lead-types/[slug]` this component renders on the SAME page as that hero
 * door. Leaving it pointed at the marketing page would put two doors on one
 * page with two different destinations, which makes the iteration-11 reading on
 * 2026-11-09 unattributable: a reader who takes the marketing door and bounces
 * is a lost order the storefront bet gets blamed for. So the precedence here is
 * now identical to the hero door's, and deliberately copied from it rather than
 * re-derived.
 *
 * Unchanged on purpose: a caller that passes no `leadType` resolves no segment
 * and keeps the exact URL and label it had.
