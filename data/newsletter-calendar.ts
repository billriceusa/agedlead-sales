/**
 * Newsletter Content Calendar for Work Aged Leads
 *
 * Cadence: one issue per week, Tuesday. The Sunday cron drafts it and emails
 * Bill a preview; `scripts/send-newsletter.ts` is the only thing that can mail
 * the list. `sendDate` is the TUESDAY — that is the value the cron matches on.
 *
 * Newsletter structure:
 *   - Personal intro from Bill Rice
 *   - Featured article spotlight
 *   - 2-3 exclusive quick tips (not published on the blog)
 *   - This week on the blog
 *   - Industry data point or trend
 *   - Store CTAs (hero, vertical self-select strip, footer)
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE WAS REBUILT (2026-09-02) ──
 *
 * The previous calendar ran 2026-03-17 -> 2026-06-02 and then simply ran out.
 * Because `findCurrentPlan` fell back to a +/-7-day window and then to `null`,
 * every issue from 2026-06-08 onward was drafted with NO plan and archived with
 * `theme: "AI-generated"` — thirteen consecutive weeks in which the model chose
 * its own subject and nothing anywhere said the calendar had expired. An empty
 * calendar and a working calendar produced identical-looking output.
 *
 * Two things changed alongside this rebuild:
 *   1. Matching is EXACT on `sendDate`. The old +/-7-day fuzz could silently
 *      serve the *previous* week's plan for a send, which is worse than serving
 *      none — you get a stale theme that looks deliberate.
 *   2. Expiry is LOUD. The draft script and the Sunday preview both say, in
 *      words, when no plan matched and how many issues remain. See
 *      `calendarStatus()` below.
 *
 * ── TOPIC-THEMED, NOT VERTICAL-ROTATED (Bill, 2026-09-01) ──
 *
 * The old calendar rotated a `focusVertical` (Insurance, Mortgage, ...). Q4 is
 * organised by TOPIC instead — the job the reader is trying to do that week.
 * `focusVertical` is therefore optional and omitted throughout. The store CTA
 * strip already lets every reader self-select their own vertical, which does
 * that job better than guessing one for the whole list.
 *
 * History is not kept here. The archive in `data/newsletter-archive/` is the
 * record of what actually shipped; this file is forward-looking only.
