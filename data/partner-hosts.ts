// Slim companion to data/providers.ts. Contains only the fields the client
// bundle needs for outbound-click classification (slug, display name, bare
// hostname). Keeping this separate from PROVIDERS avoids shipping the full
// editorial review text (~35KB raw) into every page's client bundle just to
// classify a link.
//
// Source of truth for the *list* is still data/providers.ts. If you add or
// remove a provider there, update this file too. The dev-only assertion in
// data/providers.ts will throw on a build server if they drift.
