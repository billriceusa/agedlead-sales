              , running counterespionage operations, where he developed the
              systematic thinking and process discipline that would later define
              his approach to lead conversion. In 2000 he joined{" "}

              people running what functionally behaved like a billion-dollar
              bank before its sale to LightYear Capital in 2004. He then moved
              to Quicken Loans (now Rocket Mortgage), initially as COO of the
              Rock Bank project and then as VP of National Home Equity, where
              he built EquityOnline — their first true online lending platform.

              management&rdquo; as an industry category and authored the original
              Wikipedia page). After the 2008 mortgage meltdown destroyed the
              call-center lender client base, he pivoted Kaleidico into the
              demand generation agency it is today. From 2016 to 2018, Bill
              also owned and operated{" "}

                Velocity Lending

              , a DTC mortgage lender that served as his live proof-of-concept
              for the Kaleidico playbook — and for how aged leads, worked
              correctly, can build a startup lender&apos;s database foundation
              fast.
            </p>
            <p>
              Through that work, Bill discovered a fundamental problem: the
              economics of lead generation are broken for most salespeople.
              Real-time leads cost $15-$60+ each, competition is fierce, and
              most agents burn through their budgets before they can build
              sustainable pipelines.

              Aged Lead Expertise
            </h2>
            <p>
              Bill identified aged leads as the solution — consumer records that
              cost 80-95% less than real-time leads, giving salespeople the
              volume they need to build predictable income. But volume alone
              isn&apos;t enough. Bill developed complete systems for working aged
              leads: outreach cadences, scripts, compliance frameworks, and ROI
              tracking methodologies that turn raw data into revenue. At Velocity
              Lending he ran this playbook himself — validating that aged leads,
              handled correctly, can be the operational foundation of a startup
              lender&apos;s growth strategy.
