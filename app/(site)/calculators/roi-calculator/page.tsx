    question: "What is a good ROI on aged leads?",
    answer:
      "A good ROI on aged leads depends on your industry, but most sales professionals see 200-500%+ ROI when working aged leads consistently. Because aged leads cost 80-95% less than real-time leads, even a low conversion rate (1-3%) can produce strong returns. The key is volume and follow-up consistency.",
  },
  {
    question: "How does this calculator work?",
    answer:
      "Enter your monthly lead budget, cost per lead (real-time and aged), conversion rates for each, and your average deal value. The calculator shows how many leads you can buy, expected sales, total revenue, and ROI percentage for both lead types side by side.",
  },
  {
    question: "What conversion rate should I use for aged leads?",
    answer:
      "Most industries see 1-5% conversion rates on aged leads with consistent follow-up. Insurance agents typically see 1-3%, mortgage brokers 1-2%, and final expense agents 2-5%. Start with 2% as a conservative estimate and adjust based on your actual results.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why do aged leads have a lower conversion rate but better ROI?",
    answer:
      "Aged leads convert at lower rates (1-5% vs 5-15% for real-time), but cost 80-95% less per lead. This means your budget buys 10-50x more leads. Even with a lower conversion rate, the total number of sales is often higher — and the profit margin is dramatically better because your cost per acquisition is lower.",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of aged leads are available?",
    answer:
      "Aged leads are available across many verticals including mortgage, insurance, final expense, IUL (Indexed Universal Life), solar, Medicare, SSDI (Social Security Disability), and MVA (Motor Vehicle Accident). Each vertical has different pricing and conversion characteristics.",

              <p>
                The math behind aged leads is straightforward: when you spend 80-95%
                less per lead, you can work 10-50x more prospects with the same budget.
                Even with a lower conversion rate, the total revenue is often significantly
                higher.

                The difference is volume. Aged leads let you fill a massive pipeline
                and win on numbers, while real-time leads force you into a high-pressure,
                low-volume game where every lead has to count.
