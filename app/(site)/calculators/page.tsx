/**
 * `nextStep` — Click Loop iteration P4, 2026-10-05.
 *
 * /calculators drew 374 views and produced 1 affiliate click in the measured
 * window, while the lead-type and provider pages converted at 22.8%. Both
 * calculator result doors were killed today for returning zero store sessions
 * across their whole life (ledger kills[], iteration 5), so the response here is
 * routing rather than another placement.
 *
 * Each tool answers a different question, so each one's natural follow-on is a
 * different page: a volume answer leads to who can supply it, a price answer
 * leads to the benchmarks, and a per-vertical answer leads to the vertical
 * guide. One destination per tool, chosen for that tool — never a generic
 * "see also" row repeated five times.

        For the reader who browses the tools without opening one. A calculator
        answers only as well as the figures put into it, and the two pages that
        test those figures are both first-party. Nothing here links to a store:
        the calculator result doors were killed today for producing zero store
        sessions over their entire life (ledger kills[], iteration 5), and the
        lesson recorded there is that supplying inputs does not make a reader a
        buyer. So this routes to where the real numbers live instead.
