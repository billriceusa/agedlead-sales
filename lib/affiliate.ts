 * the affiliate domain" — those same clicks get counted as leakage to a

 * affiliate total, so the bug could raise an alarm *because* the newsletter was

/**
 * Lead type → the matching Aged Lead Store landing page.
 *
 * Keyed by the Sanity `leadType.title` normalised to a slug ("Mortgage Leads"
 * → "mortgage-leads"), because that title is what every caller actually has.
 *
 * THE AUTHORITATIVE SOURCE IS THE PARTNER'S "Buy Aged Leads" NAV DROPDOWN, on
 * any page of agedleadstore.com. Those are the pages they have chosen to sell
 * from. Re-derive this map from that menu; do not infer it from URL patterns.
 *
 * A 200 is NOT sufficient verification, and this map got it wrong once by
 * treating it as if it were. agedleadstore.com publishes an article and a
 * buy page under confusingly parallel slugs, so several plausible guesses
 * return 200 while being editorial content:
 *
 *   /insurance-leads/            200  "Insurance Leads Generation Tips…"      (article)
 *   /mortgage-leads/             200  "Mortgage Leads Archives"               (tag archive)
 *   /home-improvement-leads/     200  "…Everything You Need to Know"          (article)
 *   /online-final-expense-leads/ 200  "Converting Online Final Expense Leads…" (article)
 *   /solar-installation-leads/   200  "Aged Solar Installation Leads: What…"  (article)
 *
 * Sending purchase intent to any of those is a silent conversion leak — the
 * link works, the visitor lands on a blog post, and nothing looks broken.
 * Check the nav AND the page title before adding an entry.
 *
 * Two mappings look wrong and are not: the partner's own menu points **Final
 * Expense Leads** at `/life-insurance-leads/` (final expense is life
 * insurance), and Home Improvement at a dedicated `-lp` landing page.
 *
 * Medicare is absent BY DECISION, not by oversight. Troy is not selling it, so
 * it routes to the full catalogue on purpose. Do not "fix" this by inventing a
 * path. The generic "Insurance Leads" bucket is unmapped for a different
 * reason: there is no generic-insurance buy page to point at.
 *
 * SOLAR IS NOW STOCKED. The 2026-08-06 note here said Troy sold neither
 * Medicare nor solar; the card grid at /all-lead-types/ carried a Solar
 * Installation card on 2026-08-27, so that half is out of date. It still falls
 * back to the catalogue because there is no *marketing* buy page for it — the
 * card links straight into the storefront at
 * store.agedleadstore.com/solar_installation/leads, which this map (marketing
 * paths only) has no slot for. The newsletter already deep-links it via
 * lib/newsletter/store-links.ts. Giving the site's solar lead-type page the
 * same treatment is a live opportunity, not a bug to paper over.
 *
 * Verified 200 with zero redirects on 2026-08-06, and the destination set was
 * reviewed and confirmed correct by Bill the same day.
