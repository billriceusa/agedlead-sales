 * `/lead-types/[slug]` route picked a new document up immediately while the
 * static `/lead-types` index and `/sitemap.xml` kept serving build-time HTML,
 * which reads as "the CMS is broken" rather than "the page is cached".
 *
 * Tagging each query fixes both halves: `revalidateTag(SANITY_CACHE_TAG)` from
 * the Studio webhook (see app/api/revalidate/route.ts) flushes every Sanity page
 * at once, and the time window below bounds the staleness even when no webhook
 * is configured. The webhook is the fast path; the window is the guarantee.
